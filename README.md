# Pokédex Search

Pokédex Search is a project created by my own to practice Asynchronous Programming and to work directly with an API. It was developed after I had knowledge fresh by some Udemy courses regarding Javascript Foundamentals.

## Features:

- Search for a Pokémon by its name.
- Display type, height, weight, abilities and description of the Pokémon.
- Display base stats of Pokémon in a fashion way with bars.
- Display the evolution chain of that Pokémon, with the possibility of getting the info of one Pokémon displayed there by simply clicking on its name.
- Display of the image from that Pokémon.

## Technologies / Concepts:

- Semantic HTML, using tags such as ``<section>, <main>, <header>``, etc.
- Vanilla CSS, without the use of frameworks, slight use of CSS animations.
- JS concepts, such as DOM manipulation, classes, object literals, template literals, arrow functions, promises, async and await.
- API integration, using the PokéAPI.
